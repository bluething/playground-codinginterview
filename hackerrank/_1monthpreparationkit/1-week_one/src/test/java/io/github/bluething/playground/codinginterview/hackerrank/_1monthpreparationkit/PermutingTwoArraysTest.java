// see the problem constraint

// 0 <= A[i], B[i] <= 10^9
// from this constraint we can conclude the conditions to fulfill the requirement is
//// A and B sort in different order, because max k was 10^9, the same as the maximum value of A or B
//// for each element from left, the sum must >= k
//// just find when the sum < k to return "NO"
